## Heyo! I'm Sonya/Sonia, AI student (i.e., nerd who's into trying different programming stuff and learning ~~boring~~ things for fun)

> The essential thing to know about me is that i can't get why you're supposed to write "i" from a capital letter.

## What is this github profile for?

:turtle: Basically, i upload some studies-related things here. Most of the main projects are being openly posted regularly, but once i graduate (soon **:/**) each minor assignment will be publically available (perhaps, you'd like to see what AI department is about).

:turtle: Apart from that, i'm currently working on scientific paper (another fun thing to do in your non-existing free time) with [@bujowskis](https://github.com/bujowskis) (aka Szymon).

## Okey-dokey, let me list the main programming languages i use:

**P.S:** JupyterNotebooks contain Python content.
