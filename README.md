# Heyo, i'm Sonya!
**AI student => nerd who's into trying different programming stuff and learning ~~boring~~ things for fun**

## What is this github profile for?

:turtle: Basically, i upload some studies-related things here. Most of the main projects are being openly posted regularly, but once i graduate (soon  **:/**) each minor assignment will be publically available (perhaps, you'd like to see what AI major is about)

:turtle: Also, i do various projects on my own (if i have some spare time **;)**)... but i want to do more....

:turtle: Apart from that, i'm currently working on **Evolutionary Algorithm** research (another fun thing to do in your non-existing free time)

> **P.S.:** The essential thing to know about me is that i can't get why you're supposed to write ___i___ from a capital letter

## Okey-dokey, let me list the main languages i use
